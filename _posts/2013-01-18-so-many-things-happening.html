So many things happening..<br /><br />I'm contributing to <a href="http://www.collectd.org/">collectd</a><br />I'm contributing to <a href="http://riemann.io/clients">riemann</a> writing a <a href="https://github.com/gkos/riemann-c-client-lib">client library in C</a><br />I'm contributing to emacs writing an <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/pastebin">interactive pastebin interface&nbsp;</a><br /><br />And I never made any effort to get more views on this blog. This was me and my self, documentating my learning.  From the first post, when I was pÄºaying with C pointers.. to now, that I can contribute to real opensource projects.. was a beatiful walk. 3 long years.. Maybe I create something like this with kernel stuff, starting from proc files playing to accepted kernel patches, who knows...<br /><br />So I think is time to change and get more views, spread the knowledge I get everyday, and do some nicer posts, about linux, programming and offtopics too.. I'll try to migrate the archive from this blog to other platform. I really love markup languages, so I will try something with it .. and this is it!<br /><br />Time to spread! Time to do real bloging! Time to change!<br /><br />Cheers!
