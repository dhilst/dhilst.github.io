<pre class='brush: c'><br />/*<br /> * This example show how get sibling members of a struct. Suppose that you<br /> * have a struct foo with members A and B. With the macros provided here you can<br /> * get the address of B, having a pointer to A and knowing that B is the B member<br /> * of struct foo. This is not my work, is just based on macros provided by gcc<br /> * compiler __builtin_offsetof() and the container_of() macro found on linux<br /> * kernel sources. <br /> */ <br />#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; <br /><br />/*<br /> * You can get the offset of a member on a struct by dereferencing that member on<br /> * address 0 of such structure.<br /> */<br />#define offset_of(type, member) ((unsigned long) &((type *)0)-&gt;member)<br /><br />/*<br /> * With the capability to get offsets, is possible to get the address of the<br /> * struct that contains some data. We just need a pointer to that data and the<br /> * offset of that data on the struct.
