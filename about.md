This is a personal blog about linux and programing. Here you will find
guide, curiosities, tips and much more about programming in Linux environments.
My challenges, thougts and cheat sheet are all posted here for latter references.

I've been working with linux in the last 6 years. From embedded systems with constrained
resources to high-end super-computers I've been facing all kinds of challenges in my
day-to-day. Java, Python, CSS, Javacsript, webservers, embedded linux and much more can
be found here. I hope you enjoy.
