My name is Daniel, I've been working with development for the last 10 years.

* I worked with embedded Linux, C, Kernel Development, and JNI interfaces up to 2017
* At this time I moved to web prograaming working with Python, Ruby, Javascript, (React mostly),
  and C#/.NET core, and MySQL and PostgreSQL as databases.
* At 2021 I switched to formal verification using Coq, working on formal verification of Tezos blockchain.


I'm 35 years old, (born in 1986), Brazillian developer passionated by Programming Languages Design, Funcional
